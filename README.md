I'm stduy about ML and Deep learning theory and Mathematics

I am also studying applications, but I am mainly interested in theoretical fields.

I am studying mathematical learning methods for artificial intelligence models and more advanced models or effective analysis based on them.

Studied about Graph theory, Harmonic analysis, optimal bounded theory, Neural tangent kernel theory, recommendation system, dimensionality reduction, diffusion system, generative model, NLP, CV etc...
